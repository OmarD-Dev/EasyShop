## Fun facts

1. Omar described our process as, "It's like we started putting a puzzle together without the cover photo,
   then started from the middle rather than the edges."
2. We asked chatGPT to help us come up with a name for our group. They were all terrible.
3. We only allow 3 items per 1 topping choice (3x bacon) to keep the user (and program) from hurting themselves.
